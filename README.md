# Panthera-Uncia: The Snow Leopard Interactive Zoo Exhibit
DEPLOYED HERE: https://aliciaea.github.io/panthera-uncia/
Hackatime: https://hackatime-badge.hackclub.com/U091QQE2X26/panthera-uncia

Welcome to Panthera-Uncia, a SvelteKit project for YSWS Hack Club, The Zoo! We have our snow leopard (Panthera uncia - I called him Panthuncia), facts about them, some "animations"(I tried), and *responsive*, doesn't look bad on mobile, I really tried my best. Explore, learn, and interact with the snow leopard [Pantuncia].

## Project Overview
Panthera-Uncia is all about celebrating the snow leopard. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll find:
- **Dynamic facts panel** (powered by JSON, not hardcoded!)
- **Animated snow effect** (just click the snowflake!)
- **Interactive animal scene** (pet the cub, reveal secrets, see stars)
- **Easter egg** (rare, random, and rewarding)
- **Responsive design** (looks great on mobile and desktop)
- **Svelte 5 runes** (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`) for true reactivity
- **ZooBanner** on every page

## Stimuli: External & Internal (Required for YSWS)


### Main Page (`/`)
#### External Stimuli
- **Clicking the snowflake button:** Triggers the snowstorm animation.
- **Navigating facts panel:** Previous/next buttons change facts and progress.
- **Animated Data Cards:** Stats about snow leopards count up when they enter view (scroll/counter effect).
- **Hovering on Data Cards:** Cards bounce slightly when hovered.


#### Internal Stimuli
- **Random chance (easter egg):** When viewing facts, there is a 60% chance for a secret message to appear, even if the user does nothing special.
- **Title change effect:** The browser tab title updates automatically whenever the facts changes
- **Planet icon:** The planet vibrates with a CSS animation.
- **Vulnerable tag:** The tag vibrates to highlight conservation status.

### Meetup Page (`/meetup`) - INTERACTIVE PAGE
#### External Stimuli
- **Clicking the snow pile:** Reveals the hidden panthera cub and starts the interactive scene.
- **Clicking the found panthera cub:** Changes its dialogue and triggers a star animation.
- **Clicking anywhere else in the scene (when snow hasn't been clicked):** Changes the dialogue in a different way, encouraging exploration.
- **Hovering on the back arrow:** The arrow grows in size for visual feedback.

#### Internal Stimuli
- **Timed dialogue sequence (found panthera):** As soon as the cub is revealed, a special dialogue above the found panthera changes automatically every 2 seconds, cycling through a set of friendly messages. This happens without user interaction.
- **Title change effect:** The browser tab title updates automatically whenever the cub's dialogue changes, reflecting the current state.

## Interactive Features 

### 1. Snow Effect Button ‚ùÑÔ∏è
- **What:** A floating snowflake button in the corner. Click it and watch a magical snowstorm sweep across the screen for a few seconds. Keyboard and screen reader friendly!
- **How:** Svelte state, timers, and a sprinkle of CSS. Try it on mobile too!

### 2. Animated Data Cards üìä
- **What:** Stats about snow leopards (population, leap, range, etc.) count up as you scroll. Hover for a little bounce!
- **How:** IntersectionObserver triggers the animation. Svelte handles the counting and reactivity.

### 3. Moving "Vulnerable" Tag üè∑Ô∏è
- **What:** A tag that vibrates and moves, highlighting the snow leopard‚Äôs conservation status.
- **How:** CSS animation and a styled span.

### 4. Dynamic Facts Panel üß†
- **What:** Learn cool facts about Panthuncia! Navigate with previous/next buttons and see your progress. When you‚Äôve seen all the facts, a special button unlocks the interactive page.
- **How:** Facts are loaded from a JSON file. Progress is tracked with `$state` and `$derived`. No hardcoded facts!

### 5. Easter Egg ü•ö
- **What:** Sometimes, a secret message pops up in the facts panel. It‚Äôs a rare event (60% chance) and disappears after you move to the next fact. Try refreshing to find it!
- **How:** Random chance logic and Svelte reactivity.

### 6. Interactive Animal Scene üêæ
- **What:** On the `/meetup` page, interact with Panthuncia‚Äôs world:
        - Click the snow pile to reveal the cub.
        - Dialogue changes based on your actions (external stimulus: clicks; internal stimulus: random chance, time).
        - Pet the cub and watch stars appear!
        - If you don‚Äôt click the snow pile, the dialogue changes in a different way.
- **How:** All logic managed with `$state`, event handlers, and Svelte‚Äôs `$effect` for side effects.

### 7. ZooBanner Component ü¶Å
- **What:** The official ZooBanner is imported and displayed at the top of every page (not copy-pasted!).
- **How:** Imported in the global layout (`+layout.svelte`).

### 8. Responsive & Accessible Design üì±
- **What:** Everything adapts to mobile and desktop. Buttons are big, navigation is easy, and all controls are accessible.
- **How:** Media queries, semantic HTML, and ARIA labels.

### 9. Svelte 5 Runes Everywhere ‚ö°
- **What:** `$state`, `$derived`, and `$effect` are used in both the main page and the interactive animal scene. Effects have unique purposes (title changes, progress tracking, etc.).
- **How:** See the code for runes in action!
